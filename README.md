# Employee Analysis at Pewlett-Hackard with SQL
## Overview
Bobby is an HR Analyst for Pewlett-Hackard (a large company with thousands of employees and has been established for quite some time). The generation of baby boomers are starting to retire and so Pewlett-Hackard is looking to create retirement packages for those eligible and also looking for the positions that will become available once the boomers leave. Bobby is selected to do employee research on whom of the employees will be retiring soon as well as how many positions will Pewlett-Hackard have to fill. All the information needed was stored on `.csv` files as the company has been using Excel and VBA. We helped Bobby generate a list of those who are qualified for the retirement package by building an employee database with SQL (an upgrade from Excel/VBA). 

Bobby's manager was so amazed at the quality of the employee database we created with SQL that he provided us two more tasks: Bobby and I are to determine the number of employees retiring per title and identifying employees that are eligible to be in a mentorship program. Once we have all the information, we will share the report of our analysis to Bobby's manager so he can prepare for the "silver tsunami" as the current employees reach retirement age.

## Results
Number of Retiring Employees with Position Titles: [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/mborad27/Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis/files/7614697/retiring_titles.csv)

Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program Among those Retiring: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/mborad27/Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis/files/7614680/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

* 90,398 of employees at Pewlett-Hacakrd are of retirement age.
* 50.2% of the soon-to-be retirees have "Engineer" in their position title and 44.8% have "Staff" in their title. The other 5% include "Technique Leader" and "Manager".
* 1,549 employees have eligibility for the mentorship program.
* There is about 1 eligible mentor for every 58 open positions.

## Summary
Pewlett-Hackard's "Silver Tsunami" will leave 90,398 positions open as the employees ready for retirement start to leave. However, there are only 1,549 employees that are eligble to mentor the next generation of employees. This becomes about 1 mentor for every 58 open positions.
